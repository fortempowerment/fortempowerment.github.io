	    	<p>Women make key contribution to the socio- economic development of a nation as they contribute in community development, household earnings, peace and conflict resolution etc. <br> <br>
			Ensuring women entrepreneurs are supported and empowered is critical for ensuring security in local, national, and the global economies. Women in the workforce face a variety of challenges, from breaking into markets, finding support in the workplace, and establishing themselves as leaders. <br> <br>
			The Fortempowerment Foundation is in the forefront of building the capacities of women, children and youths in the discovery to sustainability of skills/talents in Nigeria. <br> <br> 
			The goal of this event is to inform our audience about the need to support women entrepreneurs and women in the workforce. Two main points we strongly want to focus on during this event are the bias constraints the women face when starting a new business and strategies that individuals can adopt to address stereotypes, discrimination, and biases that prevent women from succeeding and thriving in business.
